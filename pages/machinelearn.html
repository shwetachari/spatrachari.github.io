		<br>Often times, we ﬁnd it difﬁcult to automate machines to behave like humans. Over the years, developments have been made to advance these efforts. Machine learning was derived from these interests, whose primary use is data analysis. It utilizes algorithms that dynamically learn to better predict the generate ddata. This ﬁeld allows a great deal of ﬂexibility,since computer functionality is no longer dependent upon static programming instructions(<www.sas.com>).
		<br>One practical application of machine learning is pattern recognition–an example I implemented in my code. Pattern recognition seeks to perform computations to yield higher recognition rates for the visual patterns of interest. I wished to do the same in my own example. My primary goal was to provide instructions for the computer to iteratively learn and classify handwritten digits. 
		<br> Our algorithm uses a data set of handwritten digits from the U.S. Postal Service Database. This ﬁle I am using consists of four arrays,two of which comprise the training data and the other two of the test data. Both the arrays trainpatterns and testpatterns are image reconstructions represented by 16x16 pixel intensities, which I manipulated and performed the necessary operations on. The true information about the images will be in the two arrays labeled trainlabels and testlabels, which I then used to compare my computations and predictions against.
